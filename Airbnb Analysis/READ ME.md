# Project Description
## Overview
This project analyzes various factors influencing rental space pricing, focusing on room features and app functionalities. By examining a dataset of rental listings, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships between pricing and characteristics such as room type, cancellation policies, and ratings. The insights generated will be valuable for both renters and property owners in understanding market trends and pricing strategies.

## Objectives
### Room Features Analysis:

- Investigate the impact of room types (private vs. shared) on pricing.
- Examine how the number of accommodations, bathrooms, bedrooms, and beds affect rental prices.
### App Features Analysis:

- Assess the influence of cancellation policies on pricing.
- Analyze the cost implications of instant booking versus prior booking.
- Explore the relationship between cleaning fees, ratings, and room pricing.
### Additional Insights:

- Identify common trends in cancellation policies for shared rooms.
- Determine if private rooms are significantly more expensive than shared ones.
- Investigate correlations between accommodations, pricing, and cancellation policies.
### Methodology
The analysis employs statistical methods and data visualization techniques to explore relationships within the dataset. The findings will be presented through clear visualizations and summaries, making it easier to understand the dynamics at play.
